===============

3D Piano player demo. Uses three.js and MIDI.js
See the demo live at http://www.borjamorales.com/3d-piano-player/

Forked from:
https://github.com/bgenchel/virtual-piano-lessons

if you have node.js, open command prompt then cd to the folder of these documents then use with:
npm start
//we don't need install because it already has node_modules folder
then open the browser and enter the port run (shown in command prompt), for example:
http://localhost:8080/

To deploy it we use:
npm run build
and upload the build folder to netlify.com
